# WebcamPaint
Create simple drawings using your webcam by moving an object (openCV - Python).

# Description
This real-time webcam application allows you to draw by moving a red-colored object in front of the camera. The largest red-colored area detected by the system will be used as a virtual pen for drawing.

# How to Use
1. Download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt (Make sure you have OpenCV (cv2) and numpy installed):
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

Use a red-colored object as your "pen," and the application will track its movement to create drawings.

Controls:
- Press SPACE to clear the canvas.
- Press ESC to exit the application.
